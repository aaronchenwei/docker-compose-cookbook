# docker-compose-cookbook

A collection of docker-compose.yml files for development environment setup.

## Note

Since v2.x format is intended for `docker-compose` and v3.x is intended for `swarm stack deployments`, `docker-compose.yml` used in this project is based on [v2 format](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v2/) for development envrionment setup.
